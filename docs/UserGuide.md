## Introduction

**Tuition Address Book (TAB)** is an all-in-one desktop application that helps you keep track of the large number of students and their respective lesson information, and empower you to provide the best quality home tuition service.

TAB comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) while optimised for user interaction via a CLI (Command Line Interface).
With TAB, you can effortlessly manage your students' contact details faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
This section describes the available features in TAB.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  
* Items in curly brackets separated by the pipe character `|` indicates that you must select exactly one parameter from the list of choices.
  e.g. `cond/{all | any | none}` can be used as `cond/all` or `cond/any` or `cond/none`.
  
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* There are constraints in place to determine whether the value you provided for a field is valid. 
  TAB will inform you if you gave an invalid input for a field.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to TAB.

Format: `add n/NAME a/ADDRESS [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [pp/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER] [pe/PARENT_EMAIL] [sch/SCHOOL] [stream/ACAD_STREAM] [lvl/ACAD_LEVEL] [f/OUTSTANDING_FEES] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

* At least one contact field is required.<br>
  e.g. at least one of the `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `e/EMAIL`, `pp/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER`, or `pe/PARENT_EMAIL` fields must be 
  included in the add command.
* `lvl/ACADEMIC_LEVEL` field allows only a maximum of 15 characters (including spaces).

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
  e.g. `edit 2` means that you wish to edit the 2nd student in the displayed list.

* You must provide at least one field.<br>
  e.g. entering just `edit 2` alone is not a valid command. You need to include the field you wish to edit.

* Existing values will be updated to the entered values.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 f/0` will override the outstanding fees of the 2nd student in the displayed list to `0`.

* When editing tags, all existing tags of the student will be removed and replaced with the tags specified.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 t/SEC2 t/IP` will erase the student's original tags and replace it with the new tags `SEC2` and `IP`.

* You can delete the data in optional fields by supplying a parameter with no arguments.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 r/` will remove the remarks for the 2nd student in the displayed list.

* You cannot remove a contact field if it is the only remaining means of contact you have with a student.<br>
  e.g. no student should have all contact fields empty. `edit 2 pp/` will not work if the student does not have
  any `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, or `PARENT_EMAIL`.

* You can delete all tags of a student by typing `t/` without any arguments.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 t/` will remove all existing tags from the 2nd student in the displayed list.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

Shows a list of all students in TAB.

Format: `list`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding Students
This section guides you on how to find or filter students of your choice in TAB.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Finding students by fields: `find`

Finds all students whose fields match the given keyword(s), based on the specified find condition.

Format: `find [cond/{all | any | none}] [n/NAME_KEYWORDS] [a/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS] [p/PHONE_KEYWORDS] [e/EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [pp/PARENT_PHONE_KEYWORDS] [pe/PARENT_EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [sch/SCHOOL_KEYWORDS] [stream/ACAD_STREAM_KEYWORDS] [lvl/ACAD_LEVEL_KEYWORDS] [t/TAG_KEYWORD]…​`

Notes about the find condition:

* The find condition indicates that a student is only considered a match when `all`, `any` or `none`
  of the fields which you are searching for match the student.<br>
  e.g. 
    * `find n/John t/math cond/all` will return students with both the name `John` and the tag `math`.
    * `find n/John t/math cond/any` will return students with only the name `John`, or only the tag `math`, or both.
    * `find n/John t/math cond/none` will return students without the name `John` and the tag `math`.

* The find condition will not accept other arguments besides `all`, `any` and `none`.<br>
  e.g. `cond/every` will result in an error.
  
* The find condition is optional and defaults to `all` if not specified.

* The find condition is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `None` or `ANY` are valid.
  
Notes about search keywords:

* You must provide at least one field to search.<br>
  e.g. entering just `find` or `find cond/any` alone is not a valid command. You need to include the fields you wish to search for.

* You must provide at least one keyword to search for.<br>
  e.g. entering just `find n/` alone is not a valid command as the keyword is empty.

* Tags must only have one keyword.<br>
  e.g. `find t/zoom math` is invalid. To search by multiple tags, you can do `find t/zoom t/math`.
  
* The search is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. keyword `hans` will match `Hans`.

* A keyword can match a word partially.<br>
  e.g. keyword `math` will match `mathematics`.
  
* The order of the keywords do not matter.<br>
  e.g. keyword `west jurong` will match `jurong west`.
  
* A field needs to contain all specified keywords to be matched.<br>
  e.g. keywords `Amad Ali` will not match `Amad` or `Ali Abdul`, but it will match `Amad bin Ali`.

Examples:

The figure below shows TAB with four students in the list.
<div align="center">
  <img class="figure" src="images/FindStudents1.png" width="450px" alt="find initial list"/>
</div>
<div class="caption">Initial list of students displayed in TAB</div>

To find a student, you may enter `find a/serangoon n/Bern` into the command box.
